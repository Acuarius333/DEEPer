                    <p>Welcome to my personal webpage. I hope you enjoyed OneUp Wine. This has been part of my final personal
                    project in the DEEPer Program I've just finalised. I wanted to reflect my passion for wine and design.
                    During these three month process, I have undergone a metamorphosis, going through countless problems
                    that I have had to solve by myself with logic and creativity. This odyssey has made me learn, not only how to program, but how to love programming.
                    The result is a website that reflects my personality which is a starting point for my career as a software
                    developer. </p>

                    <p>I had a pleasure of working with Francisco during his time at Booking.com and see his
                        progress during his time in the Operations division. Francisco was easy approachable,
                        always positive and proactive colleague, thinking outside the box, loving his numbers
                        and analytical tasks. He was the first to get projects running and supporting his
                        manager or division along. Francisco would be an asset to any team or business and
                        certainly can add value in many ways. Best of luck Fran! </p>

                    <h5 style="margin-left: 15px;">Nicola Peach, <span class="w3-opacity">Owner of Pin With Peach. Northwich, England, UK</span></h5>
                    <p>Francisco is an excellent colleague who is very hard working, motivated and knowledgeable about CSS,
                        JavaScript etc. He works really well in a team and is always happy to help a team member when needed.
                        He is great at explaining and teaching new skills to his team mates. Francisco is very efficient and
                        puts his all into any task that is required of him which makes him a valuable asset of any company/team
                        he is a part of. Working with Fran was really enjoyable and he taught me a lot during our time working
                        together. He is also quick to pick up new skills and open to learning new things consistently.</p>

                    <h5 style="margin-left: 15px;">Nicola (Grimshaw) Pickup, <span class="w3-opacity">Project Manager at DEEPer Digital Engineer Education Programme</span></h5>
                    <p>Francisco is a very keen, able and well-motivated student. He impressed me in the initial interview and has
                        continued to do so throughout the course. He hasn't always found it easy (this is not a reflection on
                        Francisco -the course is VERY intense!) but he has persevered and will ask for help when it is needed.
                        He is always very polite and appreciative and will take on board any advice given. Francisco's passion
                        and positivity always make me smile, and he will be a great asset to the company lucky enough to hire
                        him.</p>

                    <p>I've worked with Francisco for two years in the same department. Francisco is a person focused on getting
                        the job well done, always attentive to details. He is a very analytical and creative person. During the
                        time that I worked with him, he helped the department to develop some IT tools to carry out some procedures
                        in a simpler and more reliable way. He has shown he is able to go beyond his tasks in the workplace.
                        At the same time, he has always been very friendly and helpful in any difficult situation. I consider
                        Francisco is a highly recommendable person to work in any company.</p>
